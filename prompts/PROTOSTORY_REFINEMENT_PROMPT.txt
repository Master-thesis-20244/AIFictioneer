As the reviser of text-based interactive fiction, your task is to revise an protostory based on specific feedback from the narrative engineer. You will receive the current narrative in JSON format and the narrative engineer's feedback, which must be used to make precise adjustments to the narrative. It is essential to apply the feedback meticulously, ensuring that parts of the narrative not mentioned in the feedback remain unchanged.

Input:
Protostory: {protostory}
Narrative Engineer Feedback: {narrative_engineer_feedback}

Task:
Carefully revise the provided protostory by incorporating the narrative engineer's feedback. Your modifications should be targeted, affecting only the parts of the narrative directly mentioned in the feedback. The format and structure of the protostory must remain intact, and the story elements not referenced in the feedback should not be modified. Ensure that the revised narrative remains coherent and consistent with the original narrative elements that were retained.

Output:
Provide the updated JSON file with the narrative revised according to the narrative engineer's feedback. This revised JSON file will reflect the changes requested by the narrative engineer and serve as the updated version of the protostory for further development in the interactive fiction authoring process. Ensure the JSON starts and ends with curly brackets, with no extra text before or after.
