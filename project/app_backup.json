It includes the overarching story, time period, and cultural context. It sets the stage for events and characters' actions within the story and the environment where the story unfolds.\r\n\r\nCharacter:  Characters are the agents driving the story, characterized by attributes including name, age, trait, skills, and inventory. Their relationships and roles within the narrative are meticulously defined, reflecting their interactions with each other and the story world. They participate in events, make choices that influence the narrative's direction, interact with objects, and engage in dialogues, all of which are instrumental in shaping the story's progression.\r\n\r\nEvent: Events are narrative milestones or actions that advance the plot. Defined by their titles and descriptions, events unfold within specific locations and may involve interactions with various objects. Events also incorporate dialogues, serving as the medium through which characters express themselves, make decisions, and engage with others. Events trigger choices for characters that can lead to another event or an ending, thereby guiding the narrative along varied paths.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChoice: Choices offer decision points to the reader, granting the ability to determine the story's outcome. Emerging from events and dialogues, choices lead characters to other events or an ending, thereby impacting the direction of the story.\r\n\r\n\r\nDialogue: Dialogues, inspired by characters' characteristics, are exchanges that contribute to plot progression through choices. These conversational elements add depth and dynamism to character interactions within the narrative.\r\n\r\n\r\nLocation: Locations are the settings within the story where events occur and characters interact. Detailed with descriptions, they enrich the narrative's backdrop. Each location contains one or more interactive objects that characters can engage with, adding layers of interactivity and complexity to the story.\r\n\r\nInteractive Object: Interactive Objects are items within the narrative world that characters can engage with to influence the story's progression.
