Also make the character of Grete more prominent (Gregor and Grete had good and trusting relationships before. He encourages her talent for violin. She initially tries her best to accept his transformation. But then she fully gives up and accumulates a lot of anger and rejection).. Lastly, write it using a bit of Dostoevsky style."
